# Student Management System

A comprehensive solution for managing student information efficiently. This system allows administrators to:

-   **Create new student profiles**: Capture essential information, including courses and personal details.
-   **Edit and delete student records**: Maintain up-to-date and relevant information.
-   **Streamline data management**: Focus on important details while avoiding unnecessary information, such as parental and sibling data.

This system improves upon previous iterations by eliminating extraneous data and ensuring a more efficient management process.

## Overview

The Student Management System is designed to help educational institutions efficiently manage student data. The system allows administrators to handle student profiles, course enrollments, and fee payments, all within a streamlined interface. This project aims to reduce redundant information while improving data management workflows.

## Current Status

-   [x] Bootstrap template integration
-   [x] Student profile management (UI only)
-   [ ] CRUD operations for student profiles
-   [ ] Course enrollment functionality

## Planning

1. **Define Core Features**: Identify the core functionalities that the system will offer, such as:

    - Student registration and profile management.
    - Course enrollment and fee payment.
    - Role-based access for admins and students (coming soon).

2. **Database Design**: Plan the database structure, focusing on:

    - Relationships between students, courses, and admin roles.
    - Avoiding unnecessary fields like sibling or parental information from the previous system.

3. **Technology Stack**: Decide on the technologies and tools, such as:

    - PHP with Laravel for the backend.
    - MySQL for the database.

4. **User Interface**: Develop a simple and intuitive UI for:

    - Admins to easily manage students and their information.
    - Students to view courses and track their progress.

5. **Testing & Deployment**: Plan for:
    - Unit tests for the core functionalities.
    - A smooth deployment process.

## Future Plans
